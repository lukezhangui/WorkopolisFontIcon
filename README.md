Process for Modifying Font Icon
=========

### Login Credentials 
    
  - Go to [Icomoon]
  - Login with credentials:
```
Ask Jeff for the credentials 
```

  - Click on 'app' and then start the app.

### Importing Icons
- Import your icons using the icons library. Click on the `Library link` right beside the `imort icons` button. 
- choose Ultimate from the sets and click add. __Wait__ for it to finish loading *this takes a while*.

### Load session
- Load the IcoMoonSession.json that is available in the I:drive icomoon folder:
```
I:\Workopolis\User Experience Graphic Design\Icons\_IcoMoon
```

### Change font selection
__Three rules:__

 1. Do not remove icons from the current selection.
 2. Do not change any of the associated keys with the current icon set(this includes the encoding)
 3. Only add icons from the Ultimate icon set, please do not use any of the other free icon sets unless you have approval.


### Download font and save session ###
 - Once you have finished you changes, __SAVE THE SESSION__
 - Download the font
 - Extract the font and place in the correct location
 - Make the changes to the stylesheet CSS 

### Optional but important: Track change in github ###
*if you want your changes to be in common for others to use, make sure you track your changes. Put the changed css file into this repo, and put the font files in the correct folder both on the I Drive and in the source countrol*
 - You can track the changes in the session file/css file in the [github repository].
 - Hopefully we have our main "branch" of icon font styles in this repo so we have a centralized way of managing assets.
 - Font style css is in the file [style.css]
